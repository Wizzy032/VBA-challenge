# VBA Stock Analysis Scripts

This analysis uses VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. It loops through each worksheet in the workbook and calculates the quarterly change from the opening price to the closing price, the percentage change from the opening price to the closing price and sums the total stock volume for each stock. 

It applies conditional formatting to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red. It also outputs the stocks with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.
